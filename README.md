# OfficialGrawlixCMSRevival
This is the official repo for the revival of the Grawlix CMS for webcomic hosting.
<p>There are some repos on GitHub currently supporting the development of the Grawlix CMS. Very grateful for them, but going forward, this repo is going to serve as the official repo for Grawlix CMS development. Nothing personal.</p>
<p>Take a look around. The repo is brand new, but the latest version of the Grawlix CMS has been uploaded. A dev blog is also being started to act as a central hub for developers in conjunction with this repo.</p>
<p>At the moment, we have a Kickstarter crowdfund going on. Whether or not it fails, we'll continue to bring collaborators together.</p>
